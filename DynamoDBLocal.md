# Setting Up DynamoDB Local \(Downloadable Version\)<a name="DynamoDBLocal"></a>

The downloadable version of DynamoDB lets you write and test applications without accessing the DynamoDB web service\. Instead, the database is self\-contained on your computer\. When you're ready to deploy your application in production, you can make a few minor changes to the code so that it uses the DynamoDB web service\.

Having this local version helps you save on provisioned throughput, data storage, and data transfer fees\. In addition, you don't need an internet connection while you're developing your application\.

 DynamoDB local is available as a download, as an Apache Maven dependency, or as a Docker image\. 

 If you prefer to use the Amazon DynamoDB web service instead, see [Setting Up DynamoDB \(Web Service\)](SettingUp.DynamoWebService.md)\.
