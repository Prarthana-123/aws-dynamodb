# Before You Begin Using Point In Time Recovery<a name="pointintimerecovery_beforeyoubegin"></a>

Before you enable point\-in\-time recovery \(PITR\) on an Amazon DynamoDB table, consider the following:
+  If you disable point\-in\-time recovery and later re\-enable it on a table, you reset the start time for which you can recover that table\. As a result, you can only immediately restore that table using the `LatestRestorableDateTime`\. 
+  If you delete a table with point\-in\-time recovery enabled, a system backup is automatically created and is retained for 35 days \(at no additional cost\)\. System backups allow you to restore the deleted table to the state it was in just before the point of deletion\. All system backups follow a standard naming convention: *table\-name*`$DeletedTableBackup`\. 
+ You can enable point\-in\-time recovery on each local replica of a global table\. When you restore the table, the backup restores to an independent table that is not part of the global table\. For more information, see [Global Tables: How It Works](globaltables_HowItWorks.md)\.
+ You can enable point\-in\-time recovery on an encrypted table\.
+ AWS CloudTrail logs all console and API actions for point\-in\-time recovery to enable logging, continuous monitoring, and auditing\. For more information, see [Logging DynamoDB Operations by Using AWS CloudTrail](logging-using-cloudtrail.md)\.
