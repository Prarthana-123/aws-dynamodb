# Expression Attribute Values<a name="Expressions.ExpressionAttributeValues"></a>

If you need to compare an attribute with a value, define an expression attribute value as a placeholder\. *Expression attribute values* are substitutes for the actual values that you want to compare â€” values that you might not know until runtime\. An expression attribute value must begin with a `:`, and be followed by one or more alphanumeric characters\.

For example, suppose you wanted to return all of the *ProductCatalog* items that are available in `Black` and cost `500` or less\. You could use a `Scan` operation with a filter expression, as in this AWS CLI example:

```
aws dynamodb scan \
    --table-name ProductCatalog \
    --filter-expression "contains(Color, :c) and Price <= :p" \
    --expression-attribute-values file://values.json
```

The arguments for `--expression-attribute-values` are stored in the file `values.json`:

```
{
    ":c": { "S": "Black" },
    ":p": { "N": "500" }
}
```

**Note**  
A `Scan` operation reads every item in a table; therefore, you should avoid using `Scan` with large tables\.  
The filter expression is applied to the `Scan` results, and items that do not match the filter expression are discarded\.

If you define an expression attribute value, you must use it consistently throughout the entire expression\. Also, you cannot omit the `:` symbol\. 

Expression attribute values are used with condition expressions, update expressions, and filter expressions\.
