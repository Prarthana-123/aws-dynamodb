# Cross\-Region Replication<a name="Streams.CrossRegionRepl"></a>

 You can create tables that are automatically replicated across two or more AWS Regions, with full support for multi\-master writes\. This gives you the ability to build fast, massively scaled applications for a global user base without having to manage the replication process\. For more information, see [Global Tables](GlobalTables.md)\.
