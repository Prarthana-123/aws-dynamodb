This section describes how to restore a table from a backup using the DynamoDB console or the AWS Command Line Interface\. \(If you want to use the AWS CLI, you need to configure it first\. For more information, see [Accessing DynamoDB](AccessingDynamoDB.md)\.\)

## Restoring a Table from a Backup \(Console\)<a name="restoretable_console"></a>

The following procedure shows how to restore the `MusicCollection` table by using the `MusicCollectionBackup` file that is created in the [Backing Up a DynamoDB Table](Backup.Tutorial.md) tutorial\. 
**Note**  
 This procedure assumes the `MusicCollection` table no longer exists before restoring it using the `MusicCollectionBackup`\. 

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the DynamoDB console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/dynamodb/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)\.

1. In the navigation pane on the left side of the console, choose **Backups**\.

1. In the list of backups, choose `MusicCollectionBackup`\.

1. Choose **Restore backup**\.  
![\[Screenshot of the backups list with the restore backup button highlighted.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/choose_restore.png)

1. Type **MusicCollection** as the new table name\. Confirm the backup name and other backup details\. Then choose **Restore table** to start the restore process\.

   The table that is being restored is shown with the status **Creating**\. After the restore process is finished, the status of the `MusicCollection` table changes to **Active**\.

## Restoring a Table from a Backup \(AWS CLI\)<a name="restoretable_cli"></a>

Follow these steps to use the AWS CLI to restore the `MusicCollection` table using the `MusicCollectionBackup` that is created in the [Backing Up a DynamoDB Table](Backup.Tutorial.md) tutorial\.

1. Confirm the backup that you want to restore by using the `list-backups` command\. This example uses `MusicCollectionBackup`\.

   ```
   aws dynamodb list-backups
   ```

   To get additional details for the backup, use the `describe-backup` command\. You can get the input `backup-arn` from the previous step: 

   ```
   aws dynamodb describe-backup \
   --backup-arn arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:123456789012:table/MusicCollection/backup/01489173575360-b308cd7d
   ```

1. Restore the table from the backup\. In this case, the `MusicCollectionBackup` restores the `MusicCollection` table: 

   ```
   aws dynamodb restore-table-from-backup \
   --target-table-name MusicCollection \
   --backup-arn arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:123456789012:table/MusicCollection/backup/01489173575360-b308cd7d
   ```

 To verify the restore, use the `describe-table` command to describe the `MusicCollection` table: 

```
aws dynamodb describe-table --table-name MusicCollection 
```

The table that is being restored from the backup is shown with the status **Creating**\. After the restore process is finished, the status of the `MusicCollection` table changes to **Active**\.

**Important**  
While a restore is in progress, do not modify or delete your IAM role policy; otherwise, unexpected behavior can result\. For example, suppose that you removed write permissions for a table while that table is being restored\. In this case, the underlying `RestoreTableFromBackup` operation would not be able to write any of the restored data to the table\. Note that IAM policies involving source IP restrictions for accessing the target restore table may similarly cause issues\.  
After the restore operation is complete, you can modify or delete your IAM role policy\.
